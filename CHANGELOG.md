# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — session-first, plugin surface

The theme: **always work on a session, never fragment the central Hermes** into
throwaway sessions, and make the CLI something an editor/plugin can drive.

- **`--rpc`** — a persistent JSON-lines session server. The caller holds one
  session for the process lifetime and only starts a new one on demand
  (`{"type":"new"}` / `{"type":"use","session":…}`); turns stream `tool`
  progress events and an `answer` event. See `README.md` → *Plugin / editor
  integration*. Requires `--yolo` / `HERMES_HANDS_APPROVE` non-interactive
  (the editor runs its own approval UI).
- **`hermes-hands sessions new`** — mint a session id and print it, for
  `--session <id>` / `--rpc` reuse across process restarts.
- **Every mode resumes by default.** Bare `hermes-hands`, `hermes-hands
  "message"` and `… | hermes-hands -` all attach to this repo's existing
  session instead of creating one per invocation. `--new` forces fresh;
  `--session <id>` pins one. `-c` / `--continue` are now no-ops (kept so old
  muscle memory doesn't error).
- **In-session `/commands`** — added `/setup` (configure without leaving the
  REPL — starts even when unconfigured), `/session <id>` (switch), `/yolo`
  (toggle approvals). `/help` reworded; `/sessions` gained a DIR column and
  drops the cwd-as-title fallback.
- Per-turn frame tells Hermes it is remote and names the cwd + branch, so it
  reaches for `read_file` / `shell` instead of "I can't see the repo".

## 0.2.0 — interactive polish

- REPL prompt `hermes-hands - session <id> > `; banner shows the hermes-agent
  session id (`(pending)` until the first turn) so a divergence is visible.
- Fixed: the REPL exited immediately on a colour terminal (ANSI in the liner
  prompt → `ErrInvalidPrompt`).
- Ctrl-C at the prompt clears the line and hints `/exit`; during a turn it
  cancels the turn. The working line shows `Ctrl+C to cancel`.
- Not-configured now prints what is missing and exits (no auto-wizard); a
  placeholder URL/key counts as unset so a stale `~/.bashrc` export doesn't
  wedge `setup`.
- `edit_file` does a literal replace (dropped the `awk sub()` regex foot-gun);
  machine-bound at-rest secrets store (`secrets.enc` + `keyseed`, AES-256-GCM
  + HKDF over `/etc/machine-id` + uid).

## 0.1.0 — bash → Go

Full rewrite of the CLI from the original bash implementation to Go: one static
binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), no `bash` / `curl` / `jq` runtime dependency, deps
vendored, real `encoding/json`. Same wire contract and behaviour as the bash
version (`docs/go-port-parity.md`). Still the outbound bridge over the merged
Hermes Runs API until split-runtime (#63966) lands.
